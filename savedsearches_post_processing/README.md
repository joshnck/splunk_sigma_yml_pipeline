This template will use post processing to create a savedsearches.conf style output with custom fields that map directly to the associated fields. You can use any field in the [official Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.3.0/Admin/Savedsearchesconf) and output them in the correct format.
