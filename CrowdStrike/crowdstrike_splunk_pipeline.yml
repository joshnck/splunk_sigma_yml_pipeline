# Splunk Savedsearches.conf Transformation Pipeline for CrowdStrike Data
# Currently only supports Windows logs

# USAGE: Modify the crowdstrike_index transformation below to match your internal index and then run:
# sigma convert -p crowdstrike_splunk_pipeline.yml -t splunk "sigma\rules\windows\" -o savedsearches.conf -s
# 
# todo: add support for Linux
